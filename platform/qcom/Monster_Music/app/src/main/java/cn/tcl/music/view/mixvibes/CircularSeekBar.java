 * This custom view/widget was inspired and guided by:
 * 
 * HoloCircleSeekBar - Copyright 2012 Jes�s Manzano
 * HoloColorPicker - Copyright 2012 Lars Werkman (Designed by Marie Schweiz)
 * 
 * Although I did not used the code from either project directly, they were both used as 
 * reference material, and as a result, were extremely helpful.
